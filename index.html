            <span>Radha-Krishna</span> (IAST rādhā-kṛṣṇa, Sanskrit: राधा कृष्ण)
            are collectively known within Hinduism as the combined forms of
            feminine as well as the masculine realities of God. Krishna and
            Radha are the primeval forms of God and his pleasure potency
            (Hladini Shakti), respectively, in several Vaishnavite schools of
            thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Krishnaite traditions of Vaishnavism, Krishna is referred to as
            Svayam Bhagavan and Radha is illustrated as the primeval potency of
            the three main potencies of God, Hladini (immense spiritual bliss),
            Sandhini (eternality) and Samvit (existential consciousness) of
            which Radha is an embodiment of the feeling of love towards the
            almighty Lord Krishna (Hladini).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              With Krishna, Radha is acknowledged as the Supreme Goddess. It is
              said that Krishna is only satiated by devotional service in loving
              servitude and Radha is the personification of devotional service
              to the supreme lord. Various devotees worship her with the
              understanding of her merciful nature as the only way to attain
              Krishna. Radha is also depicted to be Krishna himself, split into
              two, for the purpose of his enjoyment.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is believed that Krishna enchants the world, but Radha enchants
              even him. Therefore, she is the supreme goddess of all and
              together they are called as Radha-Krishna. In many Vaishnava
              sections, Radha Krishna are often identified as the avatars of
              Lakshmi Narayan.

        <article>
          <p>
            <span>Radha Krishna's</span> first literary mention was found in
            King Hala's Prakrit text Gatha Saptasati which is composed of 700
            verses and was written in the 1st century CE. Later, The popular
            Gita Govinda written by Jayadeva in 12th century CE widely depicted
            Radha and Krishna as a couple.According to scriptures like Brahma
            Vaivarta Purana and Garga Samhita, Radha-Krishna are the supreme
            deities. Content of both the scriptures are majorly based on the
            divine pastimes of Radha Krishna in Vrindavan and Goloka.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other relevant texts mentioning Radha Krishna are Radhopnishad
            of Rig Veda, Radhatapani Upanishad of Atharva Veda, Shiva Puran ,
            Brahmanda Puran, Skanda Puran, Padma Puran, Matsya Puran,
            Devi-Bhagavata Purana, Narada Pancharatra and Brahma samhita.
            Goddess Radha is also indirectly mentioned in Bhagavata Purana of
            Sukadeva Goswami along with Lord Krishna under many different names
            like "Aradhika" and "Gopi". Adi Shankracharya who happened way
            before Jayadeva also mentioned Goddess Radha in his work called
            "Achyuta Ashtakam" which is dedicated to Achyuta form of Lord
            Krishna.
          </p>
          <p>
            The devotional works of Jayadeva, Nimbarkacharya, Rasik saints like
            Chaitanya Mahaprabhu along with his six disciple goswamis, Bhakti
            poet-saints Narsinh Mehta, Vidyapati, Chandidas, Meera Bai, Surdas,
            Swami Haridas and many more played pivotal role in enlighting
            society about goddess Radha who is believed to be the feminine form
            of Krishna himself. According to several Hindu denominations
            including Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Nimbarka Sampradaya, Pushtimarg, and
            Swaminarayan Sampradaya, it is believed that Radha is not just one
            cowherd maiden, but the origin of all the gopis, or divine
            personalities that participate in the rasa dance.

          <p>
            In Vedic and Puranic literature, Radhas and other forms of the root
            Radh have meaning of ‘perfection’, ‘success’ and even ‘wealth’. Lord
            of Success, Indra was referred to as Radhaspati. In references to
            Mahavishnu as the Lord of Fortune and freely used by Jayadeva as
            Jaya Jayadeva Hare – the victorious Hari, and ‘Radhaspati’ all found
            in many places. The word Radha occurs in the Atharva Veda,
            Taittiriya Brahmana and Taittiriya Samhita.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlotte Vaudeville, in the article Evolution of Love Symbolism in
            Bhagavatism draws some parallel to Nappinnai, appearing in Godha's
            magnum opus Thiruppavai and in Nammalwar's references to Nappinnani,
            the daughter-in-law of Nandagopa. Nappinnai is believed to be the
            source of Radha's conception in Prakrit and Sanskrit literature
            although their characteristic relations with Krishna are different.
            In the ritual dance called Kuravai, Krishna dances with his wife
            Nappinnai. "It is a complex relationship, for the devotee is the
            ‘same as and yet different from’ the Lord, and so even in the joy of
            union there is the pain of separation. Indeed, the highest form of
            devotion, according to Yamunacarya, comes not in union but after the
            union, in the ‘fear of new separation’.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Yasastilaka Champukavya</span> (959 CE) all make references
              to Radha and Krishna well before Jayadeva's period. There are
              elaborate references to Radha in Brahma vaivarta and Padma
              Puranas.
            </li>

              Gaudiya Vaishnava, as the name suggests, usually refers to the
              region of Bengal. Early Bengali literature gives a vivid
              description of the depiction and evolution of understanding of
              Radha and Krishna.

              O woman with desire, place on this patch of flower-strewn floor
              your lotus foot, And let your foot through beauty win, To me who
              am the Lord of All, O be attached, now always yours. O follow me,
              my little Radha.

            <li>
              The Pranami Sampradaya (Pranami Panth) emerged in the 17th century
              in Gujarat, based on the Radha-Krishna-focussed syncretic
              Hindu-Islamic teachings of Devchandra Maharaj and his famous
              successor, Mahamati Prannath.

              The Radha-centered Radha Vallabh Sampradaya founded by Hith
              Harivansh Mahaprabhu in the 16th century occupies a special
              position among other traditions. In its theology, Radha is
              worshiped as the supreme deity, and Krishna is in a subordinate
              position.

              Since the 15th century CE in Bengal and Assam flourished Tantric
              Vaishnava-Sahajiya tradition inspired by Bengali spiritual poet
              Chandidas, where Krishna is the inner divine aspect of man and
              Radha is the aspect of woman.

            In opinion of some Hindu scholars as well as scholars of Hinduism, a
            golden age existed when Muslims and Hindus created a common culture
            mainly because some Muslim rulers patronized Sanskrit and
            translations from Sanskrit into Persian, while there were Muslim
            poets who criticised Hinduism and personal form of Radha-Krishna.
